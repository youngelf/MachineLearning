Lessons from Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow.


* Chapter 4

Ridge regression just means regularization, with a term for the theta
added to the cost function

Lasso regression is regularization with an abolute value of the theta
as the cost, added to the cost function. This then seeks to eliminate
features entirely.

Elastic net is a combination of the two regularization terms, which is
absolute value of the theta, and the square of the thetas.


* Chapter 9
Tensorflow does all its processing in C/C++. The Python code just sets up
the graph and then the graph is executed.

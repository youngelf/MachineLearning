The\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_olivetti_faces` function is the data\\nfetching / caching function that downloads the data\\narchive from AT&T.\\n\\n.. _This dataset contains a set of face images: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html\\n\\nAs described on the original website:\\n\\n    There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some\\n    subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting,\\n    facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial\\n    details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark\\n    homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position \\n    (with tolerance for some side movement).\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   =====================\\n    Classes                                40\\n    Samples total                         400\\n    Dimensionality                       4096\\n    Features            real, between 0 and 1\\n    =================   =====================\\n\\nThe image is quantized to 256 grey levels and stored as unsigned 8-bit \\nintegers; the loader will convert these to floating point values on the \\ninterval [0, 1], which are easier to work with for many algorithms.\\n\\nThe \"target\" for this database is an integer from 0 to 39 indicating the\\nidentity of the person pictured; however, with only 10 examples per class, this\\nrelatively small dataset is more interesting from an unsupervised or\\nsemi-supervised perspective.\\n\\nThe original dataset consisted of 92 x 112, while the version available here\\nconsists of 64x64 images.\\n\\nWhen using these images, please give credit to AT&T Laboratories Cambridge.\\n'}"
